# Specification Quality Checklist: Request Principal

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-28  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This spec intentionally preserves the existing local-development fallback concept while requiring protected production/auth-enabled routes to fail closed.
- The workspace owner-scope requirement is included because workspace orchestration depends on this principal seam.
- Revalidated after 2026-04-28 clarifications for trusted single-user/container identity, development default gating, principal validation, wiring failure behavior, and legacy resolver migration scope.
