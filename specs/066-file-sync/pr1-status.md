## Group A — Gateway Identity (getUserId → claims.sub)

**Status**: `[x]` committed
**Owner**: gateway-identity

### Files

- `packages/gateway/src/server.ts` — resolve userId from JWT `claims.sub`
- `packages/gateway/src/sync/routes.ts` — same helper, make sure it agrees
- `tests/gateway/sync/user-id-from-jwt.test.ts` — NEW test (write first, TDD)

### Acceptance

1. `getUserId` reads `claims.sub` from the authenticated JWT context. Falls back
   to `MATRIX_HANDLE` env var ONLY in dev-token mode (no JWT present). In prod
   with a real JWT, `claims.sub` is returned regardless of `MATRIX_HANDLE`.
2. All sync code paths — `/api/sync/manifest`, `/api/sync/presign`,
   `/api/sync/commit`, `home-mirror.ts` — receive the same Clerk userId as
   their prefix.
3. `buildFileKey(userId, …)` output for a JWT with `sub="user_2abc..."` produces
   keys under `user_2abc.../files/...`, NOT under the handle.
4. New test boots the gateway with a fake JWT for `user_2abc...`, hits
   `/api/sync/manifest`, and asserts the manifest was written under
   `user_2abc.../manifest.json` in the mocked store. Test lives at
   `tests/gateway/sync/user-id-from-jwt.test.ts`.
5. `MATRIX_HANDLE` remains as a display-only field (logs, menu bar). No code
   path treats it as the sync userId anymore when a JWT is present.

### How to test locally

```bash
bun run test tests/gateway/sync/user-id-from-jwt.test.ts
```

### Commit

`084ac2b` — feat(066): gateway reads userId from JWT claims.sub

Summary of changes:

- `packages/gateway/src/auth.ts`: new `getUserIdFromContext(c)` helper and
  `JWT_CLAIMS_CONTEXT_KEY`. `authMiddleware` now calls
  `c.set("jwtClaims", claims)` after a successful JWT verification so
  downstream routes can read the Clerk userId off the Hono context.
- `packages/gateway/src/server.ts`: `syncDeps.getUserId` switches from a
  captured `process.env.MATRIX_HANDLE` closure to `getUserIdFromContext(c)`.
  The `/ws` upgrade handler captures `wsSyncUserId` once at connect time
  so `sync:subscribe` registers peers under the same identity the HTTP
  sync routes use.
- `tests/gateway/sync/user-id-from-jwt.test.ts`: new TDD test — 5 cases
  covering the helper (claims.sub, MATRIX_HANDLE fallback, "default"
  last resort) and end-to-end route behaviour (JWT → Clerk userId key,
  legacy bearer → handle key).
- `tests/gateway/auth-jwt.test.ts`: `mockContext` gained a `set/get` pair
  so existing middleware tests pass after the context-stash change.

Test verification: all 187 tests in `tests/gateway/sync/` +
`tests/gateway/auth-jwt.test.ts` pass. Full `tests/gateway/` suite:
1533/1534 pass (the one failure is the unrelated `qmd-integration.test.ts`
that requires an external CLI binary).

TypeScript build errors in `packages/gateway` exist but none are in the
files I touched — they are pre-existing issues in `social.ts`,
`voice/stt/whisper.ts`, `channels/telegram.ts`, `files-tree.ts`,
`platform-db.ts`, and other unrelated lines in `server.ts`.

Notes for follow-ups:

- `home-mirror.ts` still reads `process.env.MATRIX_HANDLE` via its `userId`
  config argument at `server.ts:349`. That codepath is owned by follow-up
  F2 (per `follow-ups.md`) and is another teammate's turf; not changed
  here. Once that work lands, swap its userId source to the same
  `getUserIdFromContext`/claims path used by the HTTP and WS routes.
- The helper is exported and MUST be used by every new sync route. No
  sync handler should read `process.env.MATRIX_HANDLE` directly.

## Group B — Platform Orchestrator + Auth Routes

**Status**: `[x]` committed
**Owner**: platform-orchestrator

### Files

- `packages/platform/src/main.ts` — push S3 + mirror env vars into `extraEnv`
- `packages/platform/src/main.ts` — exempt `/auth/device*` and
  `/api/auth/device/*` from the container-proxy middleware
- `packages/platform/src/auth-routes.ts` — `gatewayUrlForHandle` collapses to
  `https://app.matrix-os.com`

### Acceptance

1. In `main.ts` (around the existing `extraEnv` block at `packages/platform/src/main.ts:626–641`),
   push these env vars into `extraEnv` IF they exist in `process.env`:
   - `S3_ENDPOINT`
   - `S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`
   - `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `S3_BUCKET`
   - `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`
   - `MATRIX_HOME_MIRROR`
   (Pattern: copy/extend the existing `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   forwarding loop.)
2. Container-proxy middleware in `main.ts` matches `/auth/device` and
   `/api/auth/device/` path prefixes BEFORE it dispatches to a user container.
   Those paths are served directly by the platform (existing auth-routes.ts
   handlers). Verify there's no regression for `/api/auth/device/code`,
   `/api/auth/device/verify`, `/api/auth/device/approve`.
3. `gatewayUrlForHandle` in `auth-routes.ts` returns
   `https://app.matrix-os.com` for every handle, EXCEPT when
   `process.env.GATEWAY_URL_TEMPLATE` is set (dev override — keep it). Remove
   any `<handle>.matrix-os.com` fallback.

### How to test locally

```bash
# Unit test platform — existing tests should still pass:
bun run test packages/platform
# Hand-check: in docker-compose.dev.yml, set the S3_* vars and confirm they
# reach a freshly provisioned container (though docker-compose.dev doesn't
# exercise the orchestrator; this is a production-only path).
```

### Commit

- `d34ba1d` — feat(066): platform wires S3 env + single-domain gateway url
  (`packages/platform/src/main.ts`, `tests/platform/device-routes.test.ts`).
  All 249 tests in `tests/platform` pass.

## Group C — Client CLI + Daemon UX

**Status**: `[x]` committed (commit `841f570`)
**Owner**: client-ux

### Files

- `packages/sync-client/src/cli/commands/login.ts` — friendly "no account" message
- `packages/sync-client/src/daemon/index.ts` — poll-for-manifest before chokidar

### Acceptance

1. `login.ts`: after the device flow succeeds but `GET /api/me` returns 404
   (user authenticated with Clerk but has no Matrix container yet), print:
   ```
   You're signed in, but there's no Matrix instance for this account yet.
   Sign up at https://app.matrix-os.com first, then re-run `matrix login`.
   ```
   and exit 0 WITHOUT writing `~/.matrixos/auth.json`. (Writing auth.json
   before the container exists leaves the CLI in a confusing half-state.)
2. `daemon/index.ts`: on daemon start, AFTER loading config + resolving auth
   but BEFORE starting chokidar/initialPull, enter a poll loop:
   - `GET $gatewayUrl/api/sync/manifest` with the JWT
   - If response has `manifestVersion > 0`, exit the loop and proceed.
   - If `manifestVersion === 0` or manifest is empty, log
     `Waiting for your Matrix instance... (Xs)` and sleep 2s, retry.
   - If 120s elapse with no populated manifest, log
     `Timed out waiting for your Matrix instance. Check https://app.matrix-os.com that your container is running, then restart the daemon.`
     and exit non-zero.
   - Any 401/403 from `/api/sync/manifest` → auth is broken, print
     `Auth token rejected. Re-run \`matrix login\`.` and exit.
3. The poll loop must NOT crash on transient network errors (just log + retry).

### How to test locally

```bash
# Unit tests for daemon — the poll loop needs a covering test:
bun run test packages/sync-client/tests/unit/daemon-poll.test.ts  # NEW file
# Integration: point daemon at a gateway serving an empty manifest,
# confirm it waits; then have the gateway start returning a populated
# manifest, confirm the daemon proceeds.
```

### Commit

- `841f570` feat(066): client waits for manifest + friendly no-account login
  - Adds `waitForManifest` export in `daemon/index.ts` (polls `/api/sync/manifest`
    until `manifestVersion > 0` or a non-empty `files` map). 401/403 throws
    immediately; 5xx / network errors retried; 120s overall timeout.
  - Daemon startup now runs `waitForManifest` after auth/config and before
    the initial manifest fetch, so a fresh provisioning doesn't race an
    empty remote.
  - `login.ts` detects "no container" (either `/api/me` → 404 or 200 with no
    `gatewayUrl`), clears the just-written `auth.json`, prints a friendly
    two-line message, and exits 0 without writing `config.json`.
  - New `tests/unit/daemon-poll.test.ts` covers happy/wait/timeout/401/
    5xx-retry/network-error paths with fake timers.

## How to pick up this work (new agents read this)

1. Read this file top to bottom.
2. Pick a group whose status is `[ ]` and whose `Owner` is `(unassigned)`.
3. Update the group's status to `[~] in progress` and set `Owner` to your agent name.
4. Follow the acceptance criteria for that group. Write tests first where noted.
5. Run `bun run lint` + `bun run build` + the group's tests before committing.
6. Commit with a conventional commit message: `feat(066): <group> — <summary>`.
   Do NOT add co-authored-by lines.
7. Update this file: set status to `[x]` with your commit SHA.
8. Push your commit if you can, otherwise leave a note in the group's section.

**Constraints**:
- Do NOT touch files outside your group's file list.
- Do NOT run `docker compose down -v`.
- Do NOT use worktree isolation.
- Do NOT rebase main or force-push.
- Keep the status file current — it's the handoff contract.

## Group D — home-mirror userId alignment (post-hoc)

**Status**: `[x]` committed (`e5b72dc`)
**Owner**: team-lead

Surfaced by gateway-identity in Group A's completion note: home-mirror was
still reading `process.env.MATRIX_HANDLE` as its R2 prefix at startup, while
the rest of the gateway had switched to `claims.sub`. That would have split
the bucket into two prefix spaces per user (handle for push, Clerk userId
for pull) and broken sync silently.

### Files

- `packages/platform/src/orchestrator.ts` — `buildEnv` accepts `clerkUserId`;
  provision / upgrade / rollingRestart pass it through from the DB record.
  Emits `MATRIX_USER_ID=<clerk>` env var on every create.
- `packages/gateway/src/server.ts` — home-mirror `userId` reads
  `MATRIX_USER_ID` first, falls back to `MATRIX_HANDLE` for dev-mode.
- `tests/platform/orchestrator.test.ts` — asserts `MATRIX_USER_ID` is set
  on provision, upgrade, and rollingRestart Env arrays.

### Verification

- `bun run test tests/platform` — 251/251 (was 249 pre-fix, +2 new tests).
- `bun run test tests/gateway/sync` — 178/178 (Group A's 187 plus additions).

## Post-review fixes

Post-review audit surfaced defense-in-depth gaps and silent-failure hotspots across
the four landed commits. Fix waves below; each is scoped to one teammate's files
and landed as a single conventional commit.

- [x] Group A hardening — fix-gateway — commit `247d066`. Tightened
  `validateSyncJwt` to reject empty `sub`/`handle`; added a debug log when
  JWT verification fails in `authMiddleware` (fall-through behaviour kept);
  warn-once when `getUserIdFromContext` drops to `"default"`; loud-fail in
  `server.ts` home-mirror init when `NODE_ENV=production` and
  `MATRIX_USER_ID` is absent (with a dev-mode warn when falling back to
  `MATRIX_HANDLE`). Extended `tests/gateway/sync/user-id-from-jwt.test.ts`
  with empty-`sub` and tampered-JWT cases (7 tests total in that file;
  all 16 auth-jwt + user-id-from-jwt tests pass).
- [~] Group B hardening — fix-platform — in progress. Scope:
  (1) assert `record.clerkUserId` in `orchestrator.upgrade` / `rollingRestart`
  before calling `buildEnv` (silent-failure #12);
  (2) startup warning when `MATRIX_HOME_MIRROR=true` and any of
  `S3_ENDPOINT`/`S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`/`S3_BUCKET` are
  missing (silent-failure #6);
  (3) test for `/auth/device*` short-circuit in container-proxy middleware
  (Review B H1);
  (4) retire legacy `{handle}.matrix-os.com` subdomain proxy middleware
  (user-approved).
- [~] Group C hardening — fix-client — in progress. Scope:
  (1) `login.ts` preserves auth + skips config write on transient `/api/me`
  errors (Review C C1 / silent-failure #9) — prune dead `!me.gatewayUrl`
  branch now that `/api/me` always returns `gatewayUrl` on 200;
  (2) `daemon/index.ts` `waitForManifest` logs generic messages instead of
  raw error text (Review C C2 / silent-failure #8), adds a `Content-Type`
  JSON guard, and hard-fails after 3 consecutive non-JSON responses;
  (3) include `gatewayUrl` in poll warnings + timeout error (Review C H3
  / silent-failure #10);
  (4) collapse duplicate token-store import in `daemon/index.ts` (Review C N1);
  (5) NEW `tests/unit/login.test.ts` covers 404/500/throw/200 paths
  (silent-failure #11 / Review C N5).
