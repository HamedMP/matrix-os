## Instructions

Draft a short, friendly customer reply based on the conversation context and the arguments above. The reply should:

- Be written **as Hamed** (first person, casual but professional tone)
- Be concise - customers don't need internal details, just what happened and what they should do
- Focus on what was done and what the customer should try next
- Never mention internal tooling (Fly CLI, SSH, machine IDs, volume IDs) unless the customer is technical and it's relevant
- Never blame the customer
- If something was fixed, say so directly
- If they need to take an action (refresh page, retry, re-scan QR), say so clearly
- Use plain language, no jargon

Output ONLY the reply text, nothing else. No quotes, no "Here's the reply:", no explanation. Just the message ready to copy-paste.
