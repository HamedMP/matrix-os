## What is Matrix OS?

Matrix OS is an AI-native operating system that combines your OS, messaging, social network, and AI assistant into a single platform. You describe what you need in natural language. It writes the software into existence.

Built on the Claude Agent SDK, Matrix OS treats AI as the kernel. Everything is a file. The system heals itself, evolves its own capabilities, and is reachable through multiple channels: a web desktop, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, and the Matrix protocol.

<Callout type="info" title="Everything you create is a file you own">
  Apps live in `~/matrixos/apps/`, config in `~/matrixos/system/`, agent prompts in `~/matrixos/agents/`. Back up your OS by copying a folder.
</Callout>

## Core Principles

<Cards>
  <Card title="Everything Is a File">
    The file system is the single source of truth. Config, agents, skills, themes, data -- all files you own.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Is the Kernel">
    The Claude Agent SDK is the kernel. Every user action flows through AI agents that understand context and take action.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Headless Core, Multi-Shell">
    The core works without a UI. The web desktop is one of many shells (Telegram, CLI, mobile).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Healing and Self-Expanding">
    The OS patches itself when things break and creates new capabilities on demand.

## Web 4 Vision

Matrix OS is the foundation for **Web 4**: a world where your AI runs on all your devices, syncs via peer-to-peer git, communicates through federated identity (`@you:matrix-os.com`), and your AI agent has its own identity (`@you_ai:matrix-os.com`) that can negotiate with other AIs on your behalf.
