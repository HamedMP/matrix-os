## Developer Documentation

This section covers the technical internals of Matrix OS for developers who want to understand the architecture, contribute to the project, or build extensions.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript 5.5+ (strict mode, ES modules)
- **Runtime**: Node.js 24+
- **AI**: Claude Agent SDK V1 with Opus 4.6
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16, React 19
- **Backend**: Hono (HTTP/WebSocket gateway)
- **Database**: SQLite via Drizzle ORM (WAL mode)
- **Validation**: Zod 4
- **Testing**: Vitest (99-100% coverage target)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (install), bun (scripts)

## Key Concepts

### Agent Is the Kernel

The Claude Agent SDK `query()` with `resume` serves as the kernel. Every user action flows through AI agents that understand context and take action. The kernel dispatches to specialized sub-agents: Builder, Researcher, Deployer, Healer, and Evolver.

### IPC via MCP

The kernel communicates with the system through 26 IPC tools exposed as an in-process MCP server. Tools include file operations, git snapshots, skill loading, cron management, and more.

### Hooks

Hooks intercept agent actions before and after execution. They provide permission checks, git snapshots, healing triggers, and protected file enforcement.
