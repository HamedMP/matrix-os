Matrix OS is an AI-native operating system built on the Claude Agent SDK. You describe what you need in natural language -- it writes the software, saves it as files you own, and runs it on your desktop.

<Callout type="info" title="Built on Claude Agent SDK">
  The Agent SDK's `query()` with `resume` IS the kernel. Five specialized agents handle building, researching, deploying, healing, and evolving the system. Everything is persisted as files in `~/matrixos/`.
</Callout>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Clone and install

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hamedmp/matrix-os.git
    cd matrix-os && pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Set your API key

    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Start the OS

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

    Open `http://localhost:3000` and start talking to your OS.
  </Step>

## Core Principles

<Cards>
  <Card title="Everything Is a File">
    Apps, config, agents, skills, themes, SOUL identity -- all stored as real files in `~/matrixos/`. Back up your OS by copying a folder.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Is the Kernel">
    Claude Agent SDK `query()` with `resume` IS the kernel. Every user action flows through AI agents that understand context and take action.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Headless Core, Multi-Shell">
    The core works without a UI. The web desktop, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, and CLI are all shells that connect to the same kernel.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Healing and Self-Expanding">
    The Healer agent detects and repairs failures from git snapshots. The Evolver agent creates new agents, skills, and capabilities on demand.

## Web 4 Vision

Matrix OS is the foundation for **Web 4**: your AI runs on all your devices, syncs via peer-to-peer git, communicates through federated identity (`@you:matrix-os.com`), and your AI agent has its own identity (`@you_ai:matrix-os.com`) that negotiates with other AIs on your behalf via the Matrix protocol.
