Matrix OS is an AI-native operating system that combines your OS, messaging, social network, and AI assistant into a single platform. Describe what you need in natural language -- it writes the software into existence.

<Callout type="info" title="Built on Claude Agent SDK">
  Matrix OS uses the Claude Agent SDK as its kernel. Every action flows through AI agents that understand context and take action. Everything is a file you own.
</Callout>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install dependencies

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AiOS-world/matrix-os.git
    cd matrix-os && pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Set your API key

    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Start the OS

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

    Open `http://localhost:3000` and start talking to your OS.
  </Step>

## Core Principles

<Cards>
  <Card title="Everything Is a File">
    The file system is the single source of truth. Config, agents, skills, themes, data -- all files you own.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Is the Kernel">
    Claude Agent SDK `query()` with `resume` IS the kernel. Every user action flows through AI agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Headless Core, Multi-Shell">
    The core works without a UI. The web desktop is one of many shells (Telegram, CLI, Discord, mobile).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Healing">
    The OS patches itself when things break and creates new capabilities on demand.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Web 4 Vision

Matrix OS is the foundation for **Web 4**: a world where your AI runs on all your devices, syncs via peer-to-peer git, communicates through federated identity (`@you:matrix-os.com`), and your AI agent has its own identity that negotiates with other AIs on your behalf.
