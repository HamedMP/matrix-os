# Getting Started with Matrix OS

Matrix OS is an AI-native operating system that runs in the cloud. You get your own instance at `{your-handle}.matrix-os.com` with a full desktop environment, AI assistant, and file system.

## Create Your Account

1. Visit [matrix-os.com](https://matrix-os.com)
2. Click **Get Started**
3. Choose a username -- this becomes your handle (e.g., `alice` gives you `alice.matrix-os.com`)
4. Complete the signup process

Your Matrix OS instance is automatically provisioned. This takes about 30 seconds.

## Access Your Instance

Once provisioned, visit your personal URL:

```
https://{your-handle}.matrix-os.com
```

You'll see the Matrix OS desktop with:
- **Chat panel** -- talk to your AI assistant
- **File browser** -- your persistent file system
- **Terminal** -- full shell access
- **App viewer** -- run and build apps

## Your Identity

Every Matrix OS user gets a federated identity:

- **Your handle**: `@{username}:matrix-os.com`
- **Your AI**: `@{username}_ai:matrix-os.com`

Your AI assistant has its own identity and can communicate with other users' AIs.

## Dashboard

Visit [matrix-os.com/dashboard](https://matrix-os.com/dashboard) to:
- See your instance status (running/stopped)
- Quick-link to your Matrix OS desktop
- View your usage

## Auto Sleep/Wake

To save resources, your instance automatically sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity. When you visit your URL again, it wakes up automatically (takes a few seconds).

## What You Can Do

### Talk to Your AI
Open the chat panel and describe what you need. Your AI can:
- Create files and applications
- Browse the web and research topics
- Manage your schedule and tasks
- Build custom tools and automations

### Build Apps
Describe an app in natural language and your AI builds it. Apps persist in your file system and can be shared.

### Connect Channels

- Telegram
- Discord
- Slack
- WhatsApp

Configure channels in your system settings.

### Social Features
