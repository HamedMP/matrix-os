  Push current branch changes to origin and create or update the corresponding
  pull request; use when asked to push, publish updates, or create pull request.

# Push

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI is installed and available in `PATH`.
- `gh auth status` succeeds for GitHub operations in this repo.

## Goals

- Push current branch changes to `origin` safely.
- Create a PR if none exists for the branch, otherwise update the existing PR.
- Keep branch history clean when remote has moved.

## Related Skills

- `pull`: use this when push is rejected or sync is not clean (non-fast-forward,
  merge conflict risk, or stale branch).

## Steps

1. Identify current branch and confirm remote state.
2. Run local validation before pushing. For Matrix OS, use the narrowest
   relevant checks first, and use the full pre-PR suite before handoff when the
   scope warrants it:
   - `bun run typecheck`
   - `bun run check:patterns:diff`
   - `bun run test`
   - `bun run test:e2e` for user-visible shell/browser flows or PR handoff
3. Push branch to `origin` with upstream tracking if needed, using whatever
   remote URL is already configured.
4. If push is not clean/rejected:
   - If the failure is a non-fast-forward or sync problem, run the `pull`
     skill to merge `origin/main`, resolve conflicts, and rerun validation.
   - Push again; use `--force-with-lease` only when history was rewritten.
   - If the failure is due to auth, permissions, or workflow restrictions on
     the configured remote, stop and surface the exact error instead of
     rewriting remotes or switching protocols as a workaround.

5. Ensure a PR exists for the branch:
   - If no PR exists, create one.
   - If a PR exists and is open, update it.
   - If branch is tied to a closed/merged PR, create a new branch + PR.
   - Write a proper PR title that clearly describes the change outcome
   - For branch updates, explicitly reconsider whether current PR title still
     matches the latest scope; update it if it no longer does.
6. Write/update the PR body explicitly:
   - Summarize the full PR scope, not just the newest commit.
   - Include validation commands and results.
   - For backend PRs, include the mandatory `Invariants` section from
     `AGENTS.md`.
   - Do not reuse stale description text from earlier iterations.
7. Reply with the PR URL from `gh pr view`.

## Commands

```sh
# Identify branch
branch=$(git branch --show-current)

# Minimal validation gate for Matrix OS
bun run typecheck
bun run check:patterns:diff
bun run test

# Initial push: respect the current origin remote.
git push -u origin HEAD

# If that failed because the remote moved, use the pull skill. After
# pull-skill resolution and re-validation, retry the normal push:
git push -u origin HEAD

# If the configured remote rejects the push for auth, permissions, or workflow
# restrictions, stop and surface the exact error.

# Only if history was rewritten locally:
git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD

# Ensure a PR exists (create only if missing)
pr_state=$(gh pr view --json state -q .state 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ "$pr_state" = "MERGED" ] || [ "$pr_state" = "CLOSED" ]; then
  echo "Current branch is tied to a closed PR; create a new branch + PR." >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Write a clear, human-friendly title that summarizes the shipped change.
pr_title="<clear PR title written for this change>"
if [ -z "$pr_state" ]; then
  gh pr create --title "$pr_title"
else
  # Reconsider title on every branch update; edit if scope shifted.
  gh pr edit --title "$pr_title"
fi

# Write/edit PR body before handoff. Include Matrix OS invariants for backend
# changes and keep validation current.

# Show PR URL for the reply
gh pr view --json url -q .url
```

## Notes

- Do not use `--force`; only use `--force-with-lease` as the last resort.
- Distinguish sync problems from remote auth/permission problems:
  - Use the `pull` skill for non-fast-forward or stale-branch issues.
  - Surface auth, permissions, or workflow restrictions directly instead of
    changing remotes or protocols.
